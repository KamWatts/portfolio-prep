# Portfolio Site

## Site Overview

This website will showcase my software development with a 3-page, eye-catching User Experience(UX). The site will be created using the array of programming languages and tools I learned to use in my self-learning and coding bootcamp phase.

### The 3 pages will be: 

* Landing Page
  - Features a minimal design concept with complex CSS to encapsulate any viewer who visits my page for the first time. This is where I make my attention-to-detail and creativity shine before the user gets to read a paragraph that outlines how my creative ideas are sparked. The goal is for this page to speak for itself and welcome the user with a nice introduction.
 
* About the Devloper Page
  - This page will feature a biography about me, photos, hobbies, and links to my social media profiles. This will also be the page where my projects will be displayed for the user to sift through after reading a little bit about how my passion for software development led me to where I am today.
 
* Newsletter Journal Page
  - This part of the webpage will be the reason users come back to visit. This part will be updated regularly to outline my coding bootcamp experience, hiring processes, and how to navigate the workplace as a junior-to-mid level software developer. I will offer tips and mentorship to aspiring developers looking for some guidancd on their growth to becoming better developers.
